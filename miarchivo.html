        <div class="lyrics">
            There was a house halfway 'round the world
            And I was invited in for a small taste of gin

            There was a hallway a thousand birds long
            But the biggest one of all was in a cage too small

            I asked the caretaker 'cuz he was their maker
            He looked at me and laughed took another sip from his glass

            He said 'open up your ears and hearts
            You put a big bird in a small cage and he'll sing you a song'

            That we all love to sing along
            To the sound of the bird that mourns

            Well we rolled into town and the sweet New Orleans
            To the Apple Barrel bar it was a hole in the wall
            The ceiling weren't tall and the floors filled with grime
            But the sound that you would make would just warm their hearts

            Well it was quarter to 12 and the boys walked in
            They got their black suits on and the songs would begin
            You open up your ears and hearts
            You put a big bird in a small cage and it'll sing you a song

            That we all love to sing along
            To the sound of the bird that mourns
            You put a big bird in a small cage and it will sing you a song
